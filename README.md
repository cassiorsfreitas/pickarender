## SSG

Static Site Generator are a great alternative to Single Page Apps if you care about SEO and if your website is heavy with public content.

## SPA

Your web project source code (mostly JavaScript) is responsible for filling, interacting and navigating between your application contents inside the available rendered (your userâ€™s web browser).

## SSR

When we talk about SSR in the JavaScript world, what we really mean in JavaScript isomorphic rendering. With the advent of NodeJS, JavaScript can now run both in the server and the client, which makes sharing rendering logic possible.

## Try it!
